# Neural-Network-MLP
A Multi-layer perceptron. Feed forward, back propagation.
Created by following a YouTube tutorial by devlogs, initially it wasn't functional. The tutorial series ended incomplete, code was later released to fix the compilation errors, however, it didn't fix the issues. After extensive debugging, I found the error in the error checking.
